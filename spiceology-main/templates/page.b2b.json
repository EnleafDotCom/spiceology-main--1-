But the same is not true for the seasoning on that ground beef. A dish that's seasoned with fresh spices is going to be more flavorful, and, this is important, it's going to require a smaller amount of seasoning to get to that big flavor.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>The big flavor we get from fresh herbs and spices comes from volatile oils, and so do the bright colors and the intense aromas. The \"volatile\" part is important, because it </p><p>means the presence of those oils will diminish from spices over time.</p><p>That timeline starts as soon as spices are ground, which is why we grind fresh and ship fresh, working with suppliers who provide us with freshly harvested ingredients. Our grinding techniques control for the oil count to ensure lasting freshness.</p><p>Compare any Spiceology core ingredient or blend to a similar product from any other supplier, and you will immediately see, smell, and taste the difference. <strong>Our bigger-flavored, longer-lasting, oil-rich spices are a better value because they go further in every dish, allowing chefs to use less but get more flavor. </strong></p>"
