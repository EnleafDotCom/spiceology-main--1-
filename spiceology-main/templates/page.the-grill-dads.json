For over 20 years, friends Mark Anderson and Ryan Fey have been slinging their brand of roast humor along with a pretty good grill game for television and culinary crowds alike.<\/p><p>What started as a backyard hobby cooking for their families, dinner parties and casual barbecues soon turned into guest executive chefs for sold-out pop-ups at some of Los Angeles’ best restaurants, regular grilling expert appearances on the Today Show and their own shows on The Food Network. Their secret? Creating crave-worthy eats by elevating simple, but delectable flavors on the grill.<\/p><p>So, if you need more deliciousness (and potentially ridiculousness) in your life, grab a Juicy Bird Dry Brine or Salt + Pepper blend from The Grill Dads.<\/p>"
