It remains a bestseller to this day, but it‘s now joined by nearly 300 original blends and core spices, such as chiles, herbs, salts, confections, fruit and vegetable powders.</p><p>Spiceology‘s ingredients and blends can be found in the aisles of retailers large and small, in the pantries of millions of home cooks, and in the kitchens of some of the world’s greatest chefs.</p><p>Our “cult of flavor” includes collaborations with such culinary luminaries as <a href=\"/collections/jet-tila\" title=\"Jet Tila\">Chef Jet Tila</a>, <a href=\"/collections/alvin-cailan\" title=\"Alvin Cailan\">Chef Alvin Cailan</a>, and grillmaster <a href=\"/collections/derek-wolf\" title=\"Derek Wolf\">Derek Wolf</a>. Our spices can also be seen in the hands of chefs on 25 seasons of popular shows like <em>Hell‘s Kitchen</em>, <em>Masterchef</em>, <em>Top Chef</em>, <em>Iron Chef</em>, and many more.</p><p>Through it all, Spiceology has remained true to its chef DNA. Our “Experiment with Flavor” ethos inspires chefs and home cooks alike to dream deliciously, with never-before-tasted flavors that drive endless experimentation but consistently tasty results. And when our customers complete the circle by sharing their culinary creations with us, it reminds us why we do this.</p>",
